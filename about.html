        <p><b>Love is not love which alters when in alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove</b></p>
        <p><b>Oh no, it is an ever fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken</b></p>
        <p><b>It is a star to every wondering bark whose  worth is unkown though his height be taken</b></p>
